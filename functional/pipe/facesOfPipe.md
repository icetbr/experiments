I've been reading about the [pipe operator proposal][1] and I wanted to share my thoughs. I mean to clarify some misconceptions and show some alternatives you can use today.

## Misconceptions

### 1) It is being considered "only" because the users are asking it.
No, although this is part of it. There are many reasons the pipe being considered, popular demand helps, but the comiteed is not moved by the whim of the community. Every idea is carefuly analysed on its own merits during the proposal.

For a list of reasons, see the [README][1] for the propoal.
